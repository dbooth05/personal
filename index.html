            <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; color: brown;">Student pursuing Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science</p>
            <p>I am currently enrolled as a full time student at Iowa State University.
                This semester, spring of 2024, I am taking 2 computer science courses,
                COM S 331 and COM S 319. Beyond that I am taking a cyber security course,
                technical communications, and statistics courses. Outside of class, I spend
                a lot of time watching sports at Hilton Colisseum and Jack Trice Stadium.

                <p>
                    This is a pretty straight forward project developing a single
                    Web page using "HTML" and "CSS". This project entails making a
                    single web page with a menu or "navigation bar" followed by an
                    <a href="#about">about section</a>, <a href="#projects">projects section</a>,
                    and <a href="#contact">contacts section</a>. Also included in this
                    project are 2 images, a profile photo and a image related to the project.

                    In collaboration with a partner Nathan Reff, this project was the first major assignment in the class.
                    For the assignment, a catalog like website was to be developed for any purpose of our choosing, in our case,
                    dogs and food. My catalog was the "dog" catalog. This was for practice using bootstrap templates.

                    This project is a testing point halfway through the semester. At this point, the project uses html, css,
                    js (DOMS), and json. Both my partner, Nathan Reff, and I have a fondness for movies inspiring this project.
                    The page is kind of like IMDb.com showing movies being able to filter/search, and view more information about
                    movies. With more time, the pages could be filled with more data like actors, fun facts, and a live backend
                    allowing for personal reviews to be added.
